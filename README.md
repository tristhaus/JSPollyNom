# JSPollyNom - a math teaching tool pretending to be a game with levels 

Copyright tristhaus 2022 and later.

## For Users

JSPollyNom is a game wherein you attempt to hit as many good dots as possible without hitting any bad dots. Scoring is simple: the more good dots (blue) your function hits, the higher the score. If you hit a bad dot (red), your score becomes negative. Whereas the cousins [PollyNom](https://github.com/tristhaus/PollyNom) and [QtPollyNom](https://github.com/tristhaus/QtPollyNom) used random dot placement, JSPollyNom will use hand-made, curated levels. For now, any JavaScript function of `x` that returns a number, _e.g._ `Math.sqrt(x ** 3)`, will be plotted. This, and the UI design will be changed eventually.

If deployed, JSPollyNom is at [jspollynom.fly.dev](https://jspollynom.fly.dev).
